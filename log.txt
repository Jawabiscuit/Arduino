- Arduino project forked and cloned to local repo

- Project dev environment initial setup

- Build Arduino (Steps and setup for modern windows machines with Ubuntu subsystem installed below)

- Clone Arduino repo and cd into it

- Get url of remote repository
  - git remote -v

- Checkout ide-1.9.x-beta branch

- Add new remote branch to checkout (I named it the same as the remote branch)
  - git remote add ide-1.9.x-beta https://github.com/arduino/Arduino.git

- Fetch branch from remote
  - git fetch ide-1.9.x-beta

- List remote branches
  - git branch -r

- Find what branch i'm on (should automatically be ide-1.9.x-beta)
  - git branch

- Install Xming XServer for Windows since the build depends on it
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
  - *this step may not be necessary if "ant start" is not executed*

- Set X Display variable
  - export DISPLAY=:0

- Download 32 bit version of JDK 1.8.0_181
  - point JAVA_HOME to 32-bit (x86) jdk directory

- Run the steps to build on Linux from this page
  - https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Building-Arduino

- If issues are encountered that need to be fixed
  - ant clean build start

- Linux build and start success

- Linux-1.8.7 build (using Ubuntu subsystem)

  - Launch on Windows using Xming cannot select port using built from source in the Ubuntu environment

- Windows build did not succeed... Solutions?

  - Follow directions for setting up Cygwin
  - Build succeeds in cygwin environment

- Windows-1.8.7 build (cygwin)

  - Arduino.exe launches but window disappears
  - Solution: extract "...build\windows\arduino-1.8.7-windows.zip" to a directory and run
